## Meeting Notes with Rebecca (from MechE Refs) - May 16, 2023

### Topics Covered

1. **Structural Materials (2.821)**
   - Broad, free-form, grad-level class.
   - 12 units, attendance-based credit.
   - Involves sensing different systems, forging/welding, intellectual property law.
   - Can be taken multiple times.
   - Not to be confused with the Structures course.
   - Multiple instructors, covering a wide range of materials.
   - Requires summarizing each watched lecture.
   - Final deliverable: a 10-page paper.
   - Ideal for brain recovery.

2. **Leadership Classes**
   - Leadership in the Age of AI, co-taught by Course 6 and a representative from Lincoln Labs.
   - Focuses on AI from a systems-level framework.
   - Project-based class.
   - Dedicated instructor support.

3. **Sports Technology**
   - Mainly project-based class.
   - Offers substantial guidance.
   - Work is conducted with a sponsor.

4. **Professors and Courses**
   - Also note that https://hydrant.mit.edu/ is a pretty good resource, but it doesn't have up to date information on a lot of classes unfortunately, so you shouldn't rely on it too much.
   - David Trumper - 2.140: Depends on TA support, challenging problem sets.
   - Michael Sema - Translating products out of the lab HST 962.
   - Acoustics class at MIT is hit or miss depending on the TA
   - 2.032 - Dynamics; received good ratings last Fall, but generally ratings are pretty bad
   - 2.74 - Bio-inspired Robotics; looks interesting, but might be a bit time commitment if you are also taking 2.788. Syllabus for Fall 2022 [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U2_HJ1-sAox6rg8kWQOXSPiP0s2Q55Qt).
   - 2.778 - Large and Complex Systems Design and Concept Development: seems pretty interesting. Worth going to first day of class to get the syllabus and see course expectations... Reviews aren't great on Subject Evaluations page, but the class doesn't seem like it would be a huge time dump.
   - 2.675 - Micro/Nano Engineering Lab; Fluid Mechanics is a pre-req, but it might still be worth checking out the first day of class to get the syllabus
   - 2.70 - Fundamentals of Precision Product Design; looks like an interesting class overall. Taught by Slochum. Worth checking out the first class and seeing the syllabus for more info about expectations for graduate students... Looks like it could be a huge time sink though.
   - **2.787** - Looks really relevant to your research, and time commitment seems pretty light. Definitely get the syllabus for this class and try to register.

5. **Career and Advising**
   - MechE Alliance.
   - Career & Advising Office.
   - Career Fair.
   - MIT Alumni Network.
   - MIT Alumni Database (very useful when combined with Linkedin).
   - CAPD @ MIT (appointments can be scheduled via their main website).
   - Importance of discussing potential career paths with advisors.

6. **Notable Alumni**
   - Oscar Viquez - [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscarviquez/): past MIT student in Schmidt's lab, worked in robotics/acoustics.

7. **Design of Living Systems**
   - Project involved a Bio3D printer.
   - Course with Matthias Kolle.
   - The class project used acoustics to create a standing wave.
